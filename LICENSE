Given the basics for this game, this is simple about an angel getting souls. This isn't to be religious, I just have an interest in angelology.
I added the following:
* Changed the paddle
* Changed the tiles (also changed the amount of points (One soul = 1 point))
* Changed the ball
* Added background music
* Added a background
* Added sound effect to ball/tiles
* Added particles to paddle
* Added entrance tween for paddle and tiles
*
